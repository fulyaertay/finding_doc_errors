## This is a project that detects errors in a user's document by looking at a given format file.
```
- The "format_rules.txt" file provides the format information for the document.
- The Q-learning algorithm trains to make decisions during file validation.
- The validate_file function simply checks the validity of the current lines and reports errors. 
- The role of Q-learning is to learn the correct actions and apply them in future validation processes.
